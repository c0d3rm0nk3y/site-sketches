  <p>
    Signed HTTP exchanges provide a way to prove the authenticity of a
    resource in cases where the transport layer isn't sufficient.
  </p>

  <h2>How do they work?</h2>

  <p>In the response of an HTTP exchange the server can include a
   "Signature" header field holding a list of one or more
   parameterised signatures that vouch for the content of the exchange.
   Exactly which content the signature vouches for can depend on how the
   exchange is transferred.

  <p>The client categorizes each signature as "valid" or "invalid" by
   validating that signature with its certificate or public key and
   other metadata against the exchange's headers and content.
   This validity then informs higher-level protocols.

  <p>Each signature is parameterised with information to let a client
   fetch assurance that a signed exchange is still valid, in the face of
   revoked certificates and newly-discovered vulnerabilities.  This
   assurance can be bundled back into the signed exchange and forwarded
   to another client, which won't have to re-fetch this validity
   information for some period of time.
